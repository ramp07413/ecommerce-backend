# Deployment Guidance for Your Node.js Application

This guide provides a general set of steps for deploying your Node.js application to a production environment.

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have followed the recommendations in the `env_guidance.txt` file and the advice on making your code more deployable. Specifically, you should have:

-   Moved all secrets and environment-specific configurations to a `.env` file (which you will **not** upload to the server, but use as a template).
-   Separated your `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in `package.json`.
-   Created a `start` script in `package.json` that runs your application without `--watch`.

### Step 1: Choose a Hosting Provider

Where you deploy your application depends on your budget, scalability needs, and technical expertise. Here are a few popular options:

-   **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** These are often the easiest to get started with.
    -   [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): Very popular for Node.js applications.
    -   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Excellent for full-stack applications, especially those with a Next.js frontend.
    -   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): Great for static sites and serverless functions. Your backend could be deployed as a set of serverless functions.
-   **Virtual Private Server (VPS):** These give you more control but require more setup.
    -   [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
    -   [Linode](https://www.linode.com/)
    -   [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
    -   [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Production Environment

If you're using a VPS, you'll need to set it up yourself. If you're using a PaaS, much of this will be handled for you.

1.  **Install Node.js:** Make sure the Node.js version on your server matches the one you used for development.
2.  **Database:** Your application uses MongoDB. You should use a cloud database service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for your production database. **Do not run your own database on the same server as your application unless you are experienced in managing databases.**
3.  **Set Environment Variables:** On your hosting provider's platform, you will need to set the environment variables that you defined in your `.env` file. This is usually done through a web interface. Your `.env` file is for local development only and should not be uploaded to the server.

### Step 3: Deploy Your Code

1.  **Get your code onto the server:**
    -   The most common way is to push your code to a Git repository (like GitHub) and then `git clone` it onto your server.
    -   Many PaaS providers (like Heroku and Vercel) can automatically deploy your code when you push to a specific branch (e.g., `main`).
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    -   On your server, navigate to your project directory and run:
        ```bash
        npm install --production
        ```
    -   This will install only the packages listed in `dependencies` in your `package.json`.

### Step 4: Run Your Application

1.  **Start the application:**
    -   You can run your application with the `start` script:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
2.  **Use a Process Manager (Highly Recommended):**
    -   As mentioned before, a process manager like `pm2` is essential for production.
    -   Install it globally on your server: `npm install -g pm2`.
    -   Start your application with:
        ```bash
        pm2 start index.js --name "my-ecommerce-app"
        ```
    -   `pm2` will keep your application running in the background and automatically restart it if it crashes.

### Step 5: Set Up a Reverse Proxy (Optional but Recommended)

For a production application, it's a good practice to run a web server like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) in front of your Node.js application. Nginx can handle tasks like:

-   **SSL/TLS Termination:** Handling HTTPS requests so your Node.js application doesn't have to.
-   **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple instances of your application.
-   **Serving Static Files:** Serving your frontend files more efficiently.

### Example Workflow (VPS with Git)

1.  Push your code to GitHub.
2.  SSH into your VPS.
3.  `git clone` your repository.
4.  `cd` into your project directory.
5.  Set your environment variables (e.g., by editing `/etc/environment`).
6.  `npm install --production`.
7.  `npm install -g pm2`.
8.  `pm2 start index.js`.
9.  Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy.

This guide covers the main steps. Each hosting provider will have its own specific documentation that you should also consult.
